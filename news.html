			<div class="news_date">19th December 2013</div>
			<div class="news_body">A new build of Planetary Annihilation has been released.
				<ul>
					<li>Fix to OS/X client crashing as soon as you start the game (We think we got most / all occurences of the new crash that appeared last build)</li>
					<li>More fixes to try and get nukes, asteroids and other "big splodey" events to show up more reliably for people. Still a WIP.</li>
					<li>Area commands will now select the whole world if you drag past the edge. Useful for building up small (or large) planets.</li>
					<li>We think most cases of not getting all your commanders spawning in team games has been fixed. Please report on the forums if you find a new 100% repro of this. Gotta squish em all!</li>
					<li>Bombers and Advanced Bombers had some pretty big changes made to them. You should try em out. They're awesome.</li>
					<li>Twitch.tv and OS/X - Make sure you install SoundFlower if you want audio on your streams! This is a Twitch API requirement, not ours!</li>
					<li>Some pretty awesome new FX on the Umbrella and the SXX Orbital Laser.</li>
					<li>Quite a few other small fixes since yesterday.</li>

			<div class="news_title">Planetary Annihilation Build 58678 Released</div>
			<div class="news_date">18th December 2013</div>
			<div class="news_body">A new build of Planetary Annihilation has been released.
				<ul>
					<li>Area Commands: This is a big one! Area Patrol will be coming soon, which (depending on the unit) combines Area Attack, Reclaim and Repair functionality, but persistently. Currently supported are the following:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Area Attack: With unit(s) selected (bombers particularly are great), click and drag on an area you want to attack. All selected units will proceed to attack all available units in the area. If you don't have recon on it, it will simply act as an attack move until it gets vision and will start to area attack.</li>
						<li>Area Build: Currently two types of drag build commands exist. Circle for things like power, and line for things like defenses, factories, etc.</li>
						<li>Area Reclaim: Unit(s) will find all reclaimable wreckage in the area until all wreckage is gone.</li>
						<li>Area Repair: Unit(s) will find all repairable units in the area to repair until nothing needs repairing.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Notification System: This will notify you of important game events, such as structures being completed, incoming attacks, in particular commander under attack, and those other events you really want to know about when you're building up a high speed asteroid to destroy planets with and not paying attention to that planet you've taken over.</li>
					<li>Lots of work done on in-game selection logic. It should overall be much easier to select things, and select the things you want now. It does change some behavior though, so play around with it before you go play your ladder games.</li>
					<li>Overhaul to the rendering engine. This is a big change but won't be necessarily obvious to a lot of people. Read here for details: <a href="#" onClick="LaunchURL('https://forums.uberent.com/threads/graphics-update.54840/#post-840016')">https://forums.uberent.com/threads/graphics-update.54840/#post-840016</a></li>
					<li>Planet Smashing: The paths asteroids take now to smash a planet also looks a lot better. Try it out today! Smash your buddies and laugh!</li>
					<li>Interplanetary Nukes: You can now nuke from one moon to another moon orbiting the same planet</li>
					<li>Big art changes to Metal planets and new work on the desert biome. Metal planets now can support much smaller metal planets. Big ones remain their normal awesome selves, of course. You can also play on lava planets once again.</li>
					<li>Twitch streaming fixes for AMD and for OS/X. There is no Twitch built in support for Linux, as the Twitch API does not support it.</li>
					<li>Quite a few UI polish items. Better North / South icons, better looking start location tags, etc.</li>
					<li>Factoryies support rally point assist now. Particularly useful for getting a ton of fabbers on a project.</li>
					<li>Hotkeys that target and track a unit (commander, idle fabber, group), will now move to the correct planet.</li>
					<li>Changing your settings should now only regenerate a planet if you change a setting that really needs to rebuild the planet.</li>
					<li>Bot Factory has new art, deep space radar has art now, more units have their appropriate strategic icons now, a number of animation and model tweaks.</li>
					<li>Radar structures now have animation states driven by their power status.</li>
					<li>The commander has had his weapon changed a bit to allow more easily hitting small units such as the Dox.</li>
					<li>Fixes to bombers so they have a better time hitting targets. Mind you, their main use is still against static defenses. If you're chasing bots with them, you may want to restrategize.</li>
					<li>Anti-nukes now start with one missile in their bay. The launcher is now more expensive to compensate for this. </li>

				<ul>
					<li>Interplanetary Nukes - Bodies in orbit can now nuke each other. This is still a work in progress, but we think this feature nicely expands interplanetary warfare.</li>
					<li>Orbital Camera Overhaul - We have a new integrated camera with more degrees of freedom and, more importantly, none of the crazy disorientation when zooming in from celestial view. Give it a shot and tell us what you think!</li>
					<li>Kick / Kick-Ban - Now you can kick players from your matches. This is a pretty heavily requested feature, so we're stoked to introduce the concept with this update.</li>
					<li>Twitch.TV Integration - Now you can stream your matches from in-game! Just sign in to Twitch from the settings menu and start streaming immediately.</li>
					<li>Changes To Unit / Building Selection - Complete re-write of selection logic.  This is mostly internal, but some behaviors have changed.  Let us know which corners we forgot to round off.
					<li>Tech 1 Bot Factory Redesign - Bot factories have a newer, more distinct look.</li>
					<li>New Mod Folder - Mods can now sit side by side with game files without replacing them.  There will be a post in the mod forum about the details of this.</li>
					<li>Collision Tweak - Added rectangular collision volumes for naval units, which should allow for more accurate targeting and movement.</li>
					<li>Structure Build Atrophy - Incomplete structures will now degrade over time and vanish after a cooldown period. Walls have been given a cooldown too, which makes it harder to abuse them.</li>
					<li>And most important tons of bugfixes and other little tweaks to make the game better.  And lots more to come!</li>

				<ul>
					<li>Lobby Passwords: Long awaited, make sure you can lock down your games to your friends. You'll need to share the password with them of course.</li>
					<li>Major start spot and metal placement fixes. Please report if you're still finding significant unbuildable metal spots. Keep in mind, if you have very craggy planets, this can result in anemic start spots in terms of metal.</li>
					<li>Numerous Linux Fixes: We've implemented SDL on Linux, which should enable full screen, fix issues with backspace doubling up, and a number of other errant behaviors</li>
					<li>A number of server and client crash fixes</li>
					<li>Loading screen is back: Should help make it clear when there is loading going on</li>
					<li>Improved visualization of orbital paths/trajectory changes in Celestial view</li>
					<li>Improvements to metal planet pathing and moon pathing</li>
					<li>Support for audio on multiple planets now; Should make planet audio less confusing!</li>
					<li>Bombers now use a carpet bombing technique. This will change their overall bombing behavior. Play around with them a bit. This will still require additional tuning, but consider it the first pass. Their numbers have been adjusted quite a bit to take these changes into account.</li>
					<li>Hiding your commander underwater will be much less effective now.</li>
					<li>Unit guard layer consistency pass</li>

					<li>This is primarily a stability build. We have a bigger feature build we're working hard on. Our plan is next week, before the US Thanksgiving holiday! What's better than too much food and large scale robot war?</li>
					<li>Fixes a frequent client crash we've been seeing this week. If you're getting a crash on startup, this should help. Please make sure your drivers are up to date! If you're on a laptop, consider getting the latest beta drivers from AMD or NVidia for your device.</li>
					<li><a href="#" onClick="LaunchURL('http://youtu.be/E7Zp32Nlu7Q')">A new tutorial video</a>! Gives a little more detail on getting started. There's a known issue of it playing at 320p, rather than full resolution. We're looking into it.</li>

				<ul>
					<li>A number of server browser fixes; should see a lot fewer empty/abandoned lobbies. Please post on forums if you're still seeing lots of empty lobbies.</li>
					<li>Some fixes for planet smash failing to smash. There were a couple scenarios where you could engage an asteroid, but it would never do anything. Hopefully most of these are fixed now. FX playing is still hard on most systems and connections. We're working on it!</li>
					<li>Orbital units given appropriate vision in the orbital layer. Should result in smarter behavior where orbital units interact with each other.</li>
