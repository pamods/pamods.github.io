			<p>Boomer renamed to detonator.
Added new heavy nuke.
Current nuke uses different model.
New model for strider.

Slammer now fires 6 shots at a time instead of 3.
Slammer damage per shot is now 35 (from 50)
Lobber shells now have initial velocity of 300 (From 200) , max firing velocity of 2400 (from 1200).

Smasher turret rotation speed 40 (from 360)
Added kingfisher torpedo bomber.
Coms no longer leave wreckage (Because TA)
Walls now leave wreckage, self destruct whenever an enemy unit is visible (Do 0 damage, in nearly all scenarios means that walls turn into wreckage before they could ever get shot at)

Riot Laser Tower ammo trail now team colored by secondary (was primary).

Halley cost is now 20000 (from 48000)

Naval sped up across the board (Likely not enough).

Bumblebee vision reduced from 200 to 120.
Teleporter can now be built on water.
Naval is now teleportable (Don't do anything stupid with this and then complain about it; use common sense please!)
Storages are now T2 and store more.
Eco structures now increase storage slightly.
Armored Metal Extractor cost increased from 750 to 1000 (Payoff time is 3 minutes 20 seconds).
Changed firing SFX for Scamperer and YOLO.
T1 factories no longer extend far out from their model (They don't cover mexes when they shouldn't)
Sheller cost reduced to 600 (From 1500; this never got balanced evidently)
Thumper cost reduced to 600 (From 1200)
Leveler cost reduced to 550 (from 800)
Sheller move speed reduced to 6 (from 10)
Thumper damage per shot increased to 80, splash increased to 40.
